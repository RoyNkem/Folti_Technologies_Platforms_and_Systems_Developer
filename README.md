# The Result-Oriented Software Engineer
## Introduction

On [2024-09-02](https://github.com/RoyNkem/your-repo/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open) I got my current role as an IT Application Platform and Systems Developer. The role is a whole lot broader than my usual and previous roles as Mobile Software Engineer building for Android and iOS/WatchOS platforms. So I broke down my core responsibilities (as at the time of writing), and developed a system to help me manage my tasks.

This repo contains the resources and guidelines I use to efficiently manage my responsibilities. I believe it can be employed in a wide range of different roles, but it is particularly tailored for roles in software engineering and IT management.

## Tools and Resources

We utilize the following tools to implement the management system:
